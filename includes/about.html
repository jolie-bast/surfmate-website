        Surfmate is a surf app for capturing your surf moments — not just your
        sessions. It's a place to keep what really matters to you in surfing.
        Not performance. Not comparison. But moments, emotions, and the journey
        behind them.

          Surfmate helps you document your time in the water in a way that feels
          personal. Log what matters to you: surf sessions and spots, notes,
          photos, conditions, emotions, people, memories. You decide.
