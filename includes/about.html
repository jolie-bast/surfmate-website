      <p>
        Surfmate is
        <strong>a surf app for capturing your surf moments</strong> — not just
        your sessions. It's a place to keep what really matters to you in
        surfing. Not performance. Not comparison. But moments, emotions, and the
        journey behind them.

          Surfmate helps you document your time in the water in a way that feels
          personal. <strong> Log what matters to you: </strong> surf sessions
          and spots, notes, photos, conditions, emotions, people, memories.
          <br />
          You decide.
